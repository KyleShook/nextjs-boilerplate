# Next.js + Styled Components Minimal\* Boilerplate

Found myself repeating this setup process several times when starting a new project so I decided to just make a simple boilerplate to use instead.

## Work in Progress

### **Includes:**

- CSS Reset
- Global styles
- Starter menu
- Basic theme config
- No style flicker when loading
- Absolute imports (@components, @utils, etc.)
- Minor styling
